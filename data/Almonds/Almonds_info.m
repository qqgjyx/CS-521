% Info:
% There are three arrays:
% Calibration: Set of two almonds used for Calibration. One almond is sweet
% and another one is bitter. See the powerpoint for the legends.
% Samplebinned: Set of different almonds to predict which one is bitter and
% which one is sweet
% wvgood: wavelengths vector

% Target: To develop a classification model to predict the bitter and the
% sweet almonds.
